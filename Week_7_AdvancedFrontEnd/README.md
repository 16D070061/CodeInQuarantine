## Introduction

Back in the day, web developers would implement front end logic by relying heavily on vanilla JS and jQuery. But, as front end applications became more and more complex, the tools rose to meet that complexity and Javascript Frameworks came into picture.
A JavaScript framework is a tool that you can leverage to develop advanced web applications, especially SPAs. At their most basic, JS frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries (see below) that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications around.
Think of building websites and web apps like building a house—when you set out to build a house, you could create all of your own building materials from scratch and start building without any schematics, but that approach would be incredibly time-consuming and doesn’t make a lot of sense. It’s more likely that you would purchase pre-manufactured building materials (wood, bricks, countertops, etc.) and then assemble them based on a blueprint to fit your specific needs.

Coding is very similar. When you set out to code a website, you could code every aspect of that site from scratch, but there are certain common website features that make more sense to apply from a template—if you need a wheel, for instance, it’s a lot more sensible to buy one than it is to reinvent it. And that’s where JavaScript frameworks come into play.

JS libraries like jQuery are used by plugging library code into the rest of your site’s code when needed while with a framework the process is more holistic—a framework doesn’t just offer an individual solution to a coding problem, it provides a structure (like a skeleton or a scaffolding…or a framework) that organizes the parts of your site where the framework is implemented.
