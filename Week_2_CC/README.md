# Week 2 | Competitive Coding

## Introduction 

Programming is a challenging role and once you enter this field you will encounter new challenges and you may have to solve some problems which no one has solved before or their solution doesn’t exist anywhere. At that time you are expected to come up with a solution in the least possible time using your problem-solving and logical ability.

Competitive Programming is a sport! Take any sport, let’s consider cricket for that matter, you walk in to bat for the first time. Swing and a miss, do it couple of times and you’ll eventually hit one over the ropes. Now, consider a programming contest as a game of cricket, metaphorically. Compile a code and submit, you may get a WA (Wrong Answer). Make changes to code and eventually you will get your first AC (Accepted/Correct Answer).

Many programmers argue that the problems in competitive programming do not relate to the real life programming work. For the most part, it is true. Then why do we do it? Because it makes you a better programmer. How?
- Time limit always makes you write time efficient solutions.
- Critical test data helps you write correct solutions, in one go!
- Further it makes you great at debugging code.
- Hard problems makes you break down the problem into chunks, solve them individually and bring it all together to solve the main problem.
- A lot of big companies like Google, Facebook. Microsoft, Amazon hires through competitive programming

Yes, competitive programming is not the only way to master these qualities but it is one of the best ways to do so. Give it a shot, if you enjoy it, it’s worth it. You will be rewarded with objective benefits.

## OK...So how do I start?

Head over to [__this WnCC Wiki Article__](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Competitive_Programming) to get started with your journey on Competitive Coding. 

For those who are new to this domain & wish to learn more about different Data Structures & Algorithms, check out the [__Excellent Resources > Algorithms__](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Competitive_Programming#Algorithms:) section of the above article.

## Ready to Practice? Check out these Problems

Competitive Coding is all about learning & practicing. To help you get hooked to CC, here are some resources along with a curated list of problems for you to practice:

Refer to [this site](https://cp-algorithms.com/) for standard code templates 

If you feel you don’t understand a topic and need more practice for that topic , [here is a topic wise list of problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55274)

### Recommended Problems: 

_Most of the problems have editorials or tutorials , also you could refer to submissions for a problem to understand code implementation , but first try to do these problems on your own after reading the relevant topics._
