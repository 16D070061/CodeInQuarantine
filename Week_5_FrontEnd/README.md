- More than 1 page, with inter-connectivity among pages.
- Tables, images, lists
- A seperate stylesheet file with mobile responsive `@media` query, different selectors
- Bootstrap 4 components 

### 2. Counter 

Write a simple script to implement the following:
- The default counter begins at the number 0.
- When you click “Lower Count”, the counter should decrement by 1.  If the count goes below 0, the number should change to the color red.
- When you click “Add Count”, the counter should increment by 1. If the count goes above 0, the number should change to the color green.
