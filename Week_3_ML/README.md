# Week 3 | Machine Learning

## Introduction 

Even though ML doesn't actually need an introduction in today's world, where millions of people research in this with field, and where every other day there's a new *state of the art* techinique. Machine Learning is basically automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. *without* any human assistance.   

In **Traditional Programming**, We feed in Data (*Input*) + Program (*Logic*), run it on machine and get output.

While in **Machine Learning**, We feed in Data (*Input*) + *Output*, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

Excited? Now go on, begin your journey into this vast and the most buzzing field in Computer Science here.

   *This is for those who have some coding experience, but never done Machine Learning before. Even if you have completed the much renowned **AndrewNG** [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course, go through this article, because here we implement every algorithm in Python instead of MATLAB.*

  *Only **after** you have gone through and implemented the algorithms in the above article should you continue with this one. It introduces you to all the important concepts and applications of **Neural Networks***
