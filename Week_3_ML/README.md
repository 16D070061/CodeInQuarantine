# Week 3 | Machine Learning

## Introduction 

Even though ML doesn't actually need an introduction in today's world, where millions of people research in this field, and where every other day there's a new *state of the art* techinique. Machine Learning is basically automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. *without* any human assistance.   

In **Traditional Programming**, We feed in Data (*Input*) + Program (*Logic*), run it on machine and get output.

While in **Machine Learning**, We feed in Data (*Input*) + *Output*, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(*Logic*), which can be evaluated while testing.

Excited? Now go on, begin your journey into this vast and the most buzzing field in Computer Science here.

- ### [Machine Learning](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Machine_Learning) 
   
   *This is for those who have some coding experience, but never done Machine Learning before. If you feel your concepts about Python or programming in general are shaky, first complete our tutorial on [**Python**](https://github.com/wncc/CodeInQuarantine/tree/master/Week_1_Python). Even if you have completed the much renowned **AndrewNG** [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course, go through this article, because here we implement every algorithm in Python instead of MATLAB.*

- ### [Deep Learning](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Deep_Learning)
  
  *Only **after** you have gone through and implemented the algorithms in the above article should you continue with this one. It introduces you to all the important concepts and applications of **Neural Networks***

## Tasks

### 1. Assignments

Stanford runs an amazing course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) whose assignments serve as a perfect way to practice and strengthen your concepts.

- The [First Assignment](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment1/) makes you implement *kNN*, *SVM*, *Softmax*, and a simple *Neural Network* without any ML libraries.

- The [Second Assignment](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment2/) helps you get acquainted with *Backpropogation*, *Batch Normalisation*,*Dropout*, *CNNs*, and *deep learning frameworks*.

- The [Third Assignment](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment3/) is where you'll implement *RNNs*, *LSTMs*, and *GANs*  

You should definitely checkout their excellent [Notes](https://cs231n.github.io/) and [Video Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) if you are stuck somewhere, or have difficulties in understanding some particular concepts.
